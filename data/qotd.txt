Kathleen Mirali Tagon was just one of thousands killed in the opening shots of the Terraforming War in the Celeschul System in 3069. The Terran Formation Front launched their first strikes in an attempt to decapitate their opposition by assassinating senior officers sympathetic to the Continuance faction. There are numerous narratives surrounding that conflict. Some people say that the TFF was doomed to failure the moment Colonel Karl Tagon survived. Karl Tagon is not one of those people, but late in the evening after a few drinks, Karl will concede that it is astonishingly poor tactical doctrine to make him your enemy.	Schlock Mercenary, 160930

"The world is, of course, nothing but our conception of it."	Anton Chekhov
"'Grok' means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the process being observed - to merge, to blend, to intermarry, to lose personal identity in group experience.

"Science is magic that works."	Kurt Vonnegut
"listen; there’s a hell of a good universe next door; let’s go"	e.e. cummings

"It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety."	Salvor Hardin
"Creative work, in geology and anywhere else, is interaction and synthesis: half-baked ideas from a bar room, rocks in the field, chains of thought from lonely walks, numbers squeezed from rocks in a laboratory, numbers from a calculator riveted to a desk, fancy equipment usually malfunctioning on expensive ships, cheap equipment in the human cranium, arguments before a road cut."	Stephen Jay Gould
"It's a great art, is rowing. It's the finest art there is. It's a symphony of motion. And when you're rowing well, why, it's nearing perfection - and when you reach perfection you're touching the divine. It touches the you of you's which is your soul."	George Pocock
"Zakalwe, in all human societies we have ever reviewed, in every age and every state, there has seldom if ever been a shortage of eager young males prepared to kill and die to preserve the security, comfort and prejudices of their elders, and what you call heroism is just an expression of this simple fact: there is never a scarcity of idiots."	Iain M. Banks (Use of Weapons)

"To a naturalist nothing is indifferent; the humble moss that creeps upon the stone is equally interesting as the lofty pine which so beautifully adorns the valley or the mountain; but to a naturalist who is reading in the face of the rocks the annals of a former world, the mossy covering which obstructs his view, and renders indistinguishable the different species of stone, is no less than a serious subject of regret."

OK, try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous Period. You get your first look at this "six foot turkey" as you enter a clearing. He moves like a bird, lightly, bobbing his head. And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity is based on movement like T-Rex - he'll lose you if you don't move. But no, not Velociraptor. You stare at him, and he just stares right back. And that's when the attack comes. Not from the front, but from the side, from the other two raptors you didn't even know were there. Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter, you see, he uses coordinated attack patterns and he is out in force today. And he slashes at you with this, a six-inch retractable claw, like a razor, on the the middle toe. He doesn't bother to bite your jugular like a lion, say... no no. He slashes at you here, or here, or maybe across the belly, spilling your intestines. The point is, you are alive when they start to eat you. So you know, try to show a little respect.	Dr. Alan Grant
"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown."	H.P. Lovecraft

"That really rustles my jimmies."	James "Jamal" "Jame" "jamie" Brownie
"Earth is ancient now, but all knowledge is stored up in her. She keeps a record of everything that has happened since time began. Of time before time, she says little, and in a language that no one has yet understood. Through time, her secret codes have gradually been broken. Her mud and lava is a message from the past. Of time to come, she says much, but who listens?"	Jeanette Winterson
"My sister passed away last year.  If you think of time as another dimension, she still exists, and always will, from 1980 to 2015, but not before or after.  She's eternally pressed into the cosmic shale, just a little ways back there."

“It will,” Wit said, “but then it will get better. Then it will get worse again. Then better. This is life, and I will not lie by saying every day will be sunshine.

"Ten spears go to battle,” he whispered, “and nine shatter. Did that war forge the one that remained? No, Amaram. All the war did was identify the spear that would not break.”	Brandon Sanderson, Oathbringer
