# My Configuration Files

These are a collection of dotfiles I use on the majority of my machines. They're
evolved to match my needs and habits, and reflect a lot of work over the years.
Not only are there interesting things here, there are also some interesting
blind alleys and dead ends back in history, showing things I tried and
eliminated.

This repo was initially created on 2017-03-08.

## Usage

It is generally intended that you will browse these files to get ideas for your
own collection of dotfiles. I used to include directions about how to clone and
use these directly, but I no longer think that's a good idea. What works for me
may not work for you. If you do lift something, use it wisely.
